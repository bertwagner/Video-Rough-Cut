# Video Rough Cut

The purpose of this script is to help me edit my YouTube videos - I record a video with multiple takes and then edit it together.  This script automates process of the "rough cut" where I have to edit the raw video footage into only the clips where action is occuring.  Sections where no action is occuring (silence) are automatically edited out.
